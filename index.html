    <h2> Why Github? </h2> <!-- Why Github? section -->
    <p> I decided to use Github compared to the other alternative because I had already been interested in the site from 
      online forums and I am interested in helping others with their projects on this site.

    <h2> About me </h2> <!-- About me section --> <!-- para 1 -->
    <p> I was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina on March 27th, 2000. I enjoy playing videogames, reading 
      and watching movies with my friends. I was a military brat growing up and frequently moved, living in 
      Texas and Georgia. 
    </p>                  <!-- para 2-->   
    <p> In March of 2020, I decided to enlist into the United States Air Force. This was a
      particularly interesting time. The COVID epidemic happened and resulted in a very unique experience.
      We were creating masks out of t-shirts, had all military events cancelled, and were restricted to staying 
      on the military base for almost eight months. In November of 2021, I was sent to Phoenix, Arizona as my first duty station 
      I enjoy living here, I have always preferred the heat over colder climates and the city always has things to do. 
      I work as a calibration technician, my role is to ensure I provide military mechanics with accurate equipment.
      For the future, I would like to work as a software developer. I want to serve one more
      year in the military and move on to working as a developer in the civilian world.
