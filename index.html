The Comical Cynic review blog.

About this page 

Hello everyone and welcome to my review blog!
This page is dedicated to talking about topics I care alot about and giving my opinion on them.
This purpose of this page is to do something I think I am fairly proficient at: COMPLAINING.
Not everything I will be discussing will be negative however, as I want to talk about things I enjoy also. 
I want to preface my webpage by saying that this site is purely satirical, alot of the critiques I will
be making are entirely subjective and not meant to be taken seriously.

A bit about me 

[Include an image of your face here]

My name is Roel and I work in the United States Air force. In my sparetime my friends and I watch tv shows, movies, play videogames
and nerd out about them for countless hours (this is mostly where the inspiration for this page comes from). In fact, see our
watchlist [hyperlink 'watchlist' with the google doc] , a google document that containes every show and movie we have watched. 


I also like to do non-nerdy activities like working out and watching sports. I am by no means a bodybuilder or have any intention
to be one but exercising allows me to destress and overall improves my confidence. I have been consistently going for about
two years now and it has became routine for me. Have any questions about it? let me know here

I also enjoy sports! I consider myself an all-rounder when it comes to discussing the matter however I have a crazy passion for 
soccer (football for non-americans). Teams, players, tactics, playstyles, I can go on for hours about this sport (it truly is the beautiful game!)
Head to my sports page [hyperlink this to your sports section] to learn more about my interests in this matter. 


Additionally, I love to read. Currently, I am reading "Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals" by Oliver Burkeman. My favorite genres are sci-fi, 
self-development, and classics such as "The Once and Future King" and "The Illiad and the Odyssey".
