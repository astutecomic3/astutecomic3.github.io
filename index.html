<h2>About this page</h2> 

<p>Hello everyone and welcome to my review blog!
This page is dedicated to talking about topics I care alot about and giving my opinion on them.
This purpose of this page is to do something I think I am fairly proficient at: COMPLAINING.
Not everything I will be discussing will be negative however, as I want to talk about things I enjoy also. 
I want to preface my webpage by saying that this site is purely satirical, alot of the critiques I will
be making are entirely subjective and not meant to be taken seriously.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>My blog will provide webpages that vary depending on the topic being discussed (i.e. a sports page, a gaming page)
Click on the navigation buttons above to be teleported to each page to learn more about what I think about these topics.</p>
<h2>Thats a wrap!</h2>

<p>This concludes the home page! Enjoy the content I have provided and any feedback is welcomed! A majority of this site will
be under construction so please bear with me as I continue to develop the site.</p>
