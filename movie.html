<p>Welcome to my official movie section, below you can find a collection of my work 
   regarding any thing movie related.</p>
<h2>How this works</h2>
<p>My review will be ranked on a 5 star system, followed my a brief synopsis and my opinions on it, and
   I will finish the review with a few more scenes I particularly fancy.

<h1>Prisoners</h1>

<h2 class="synop">Synopsis</h2>
<p class="synop">Prisoners is a thriller starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. When the daughters of two families 
   go missing on Thanksgiving day, Kelly Dover (Hugh Jackman) does whatever it takes to find them. 
   A devout Christian, Dover delivers Hell to Alex Jones (Paul Dano), the accused abductor and 
   troubled adult that has the mind of a ten-year old.
</p> 
<h2>The Director</h2>
<p>
I started my review page off with a bang by speaking about my favorite movie of all-time: Prisoners (2013).
Prisoners is directed by Dennis Villanueve, the creative mind behind the popular Dune movie starring
Timoth√©e Chalamet. Villanueve has also directed other fantastic films such as Enemy, Bladerunner 2049,
and Sicario. 
</p>

<h2>The Actors</h2>
<p>
Prisoners has a star studded cast, including the stoic Detective Loki as played by Jake Gyllenhaal,
The high octane and improvising Kelly Dover played by Hugh Jackman, and the unsettling disposition
of Alex Jones played by Paul Dano.
</p>

<h2>Hugh Jackman</h2>
<p>The performance of Hugh Jackman in this movie is spectacular, I have watched every X-Men and Wolverine
movie to date, and I am confident in saying this is his best acting performance. What makes his
role as Kelly Dover work so well is his ability to make people resonate with his emotions in the movie.
For example, Take the scene in which he is spying on Alex Jones as he is walking his dog late in the 
night. As Jones is walking the dog, he pauses by the sidewalk, and randomly begins to hang the dog by 
its leash with a smile on his face. When Dover sees this happen, he immediately reaches in his coat for his pistol,
with a face of absolute disgust. When watching this with friends and family who have never seen the movie,
they exclaim and jump out of their seats. They are pissed off just like Dover, and seeing him later on torturing
Jones seems more like justice than flat out senseless violence.
</p>
<p>Still not convinced? Check out this scene from the movie.</p>
